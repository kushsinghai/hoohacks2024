tides i have grown up i am a father now everything has changed but i am still the same somehow you know ive never been afraid of death but now i wan na see the things that havent happened yet i still love getting out of my mind i should cut it down i still know people i dont like and i should cut them out i feel embarrassed bout the things that i did in my youth cause now i have a child i know one day that you will do freight cargo dot stops and aeroplanes latenight calls signal is in and out again feelin low serotonin known better days go go go but every moment youre here with me timе stops to still when you are in my arms it always will and life lifе is changin tides i lost the confidence in who i was to busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up i have the same dream every night a bullet through my brain the moment that i close my eyes i still have to lean on a shoulder when ive broken down and i have people that depend on me to sort them out i sometimes fantasise i disappear without a trace i have no regrets but wish i did things in a different way low fly zone lawsuits and film stars headline wrote the princess and the face scar broken bones breakins and babylon go go go but every moment youre here with me time stops to still when you are in my arms it always will and life life is changin tides time stops to still when you are in my arms it always will and life life is changin tides
