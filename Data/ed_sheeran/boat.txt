boat came in for the embers stayed out for the breeze i need to feel elements to remind me theres beauty when its bleak stuck out long before lights down why do i breathe oh i know the more that i love the less that i feel the times that i jumped never were real they say that all scars will heal but i know maybe i wont but the waves wont break my boat but the waves wont break my boat stones crash on the boardwalk the wind rush through the trees i keep my eyes peeled the memories always fall short of what we couldve been left out long before last call what do i need oh i know the more that i love the less that i feel the times that i jumped never were real they say that all scars will heal but i know maybe i wont but the waves wont break my boat but the waves wont break my boat but the waves wont break my boat the waves wont break my boat the more that i love the less that i feel the times that i jumped never were real they say that all scars will heal but i know maybe i wont and the waves wont break my boat
