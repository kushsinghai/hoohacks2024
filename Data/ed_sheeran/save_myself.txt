save myself i gave all my oxygen to people that could breath i gave away my money and now we dont even speak i drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me oh honestly offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm they gave me the heartache and in return i gave a song it goes on and on and on life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell so before i save someone else ive got to save myself i gave you all my energy and i took away your pain cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain what line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same and only scars remain life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell so before i save someone else ive got to save myself but if i dont then ill go back to where im rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that oh im here again between the devil and the danger but i guess its just my nature my dad was wrong cause im not like my mum cause shed just smile and im complaining in a song but it helps so before i save someone else ive got to save myself life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell so before i save someone else ive got to save myself and before i blame someone else ive got to save myself and before i love someone else ive got to love myself
